    </h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;"> I started learning at AkiraChix from february 3rd this year and throughout the four weeks, I have gained a lot of new skills about  frontend web and mobile development, data structures, quality assurance, product management, ux/ui design and research.
</p>
<p>In Frontend Web class, I learnt to use a new language called HTML ( Hyper text Markup Language). Where the trainer explained for us :</p>
        <ul style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;">
            <li>Basic commands to create a website like this one  </li>
            <li>How to deploy a website </li>
            <li> How to create a login ui using forms in an html file </li>
            <li>How to use github to keep and upload all your work on</li>
<p>The trainer also influenced me to self-train and practice</p>
            <li> Using tables in html</li>
            <li>Designing a sign-in ui page and link it to the official web page</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;"> Regardless of all that though, AkiraChix had a lot of enjoyable things to offer for example:</p>
    <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;">
        <li>A tour of the campus by the alumni</li>
        <li>Four daily delicious and nutritious meals</li>
        <li>Hot showers in the mornings!</li>
        <li>A great First Aid & Safety Awareness training session</li>
        <li>Role play educative and funny presentation </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times;font-size: 20px;"> In sum, all AkiraChix staff and alumni have been nothing but welcoming and kind, 
    Infact they even provided me a room to pray and accomodated me while I was fasting!<br> It might have been hard to adjust to the quick schedule 
    but all things considered I had a great experience.</p>
